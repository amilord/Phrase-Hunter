In this project I created a word "Phrase Hunter" game kind of like a digital hangman. The instructions consisted of using Javascript and OOP to select a random hidden phrase where the player playing the game tries to guess the phrase, while maintaining their lives. Everytime the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen. You continue to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).The player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, the programming will disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.

Extra Credit:

Add keyboard functionality
Let players use their physical computer keyboard to enter guesses. You'll need to use the keydown or keyup event.

Making the project your own
The general layout should remain the same, but feel free to make the project your own by experimenting with things like color, background color, font, borders, shadows, transitions, animations, filters, etc.
Detail your style changes in your README.md file and in your submission notes.
