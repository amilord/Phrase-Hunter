In this project I created a word "Phrase Hunter" game kind of like a digital hangman. The instructions consisted of using Javascript and OOP to select a random hidden phrase where the player playing the game tries to guess the phrase, while maintaining their lives. Everytime the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen. You continue to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).The player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, the programming will disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.
